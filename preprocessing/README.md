### DataSet structure
Our rawdata has many batches, which come from so many differents hospitals. So We have strictly defined the file structures and data format from scratch.

Among all the folders and files, `dicom_files_merges`, `nii_files_merges`, `csv_files/rib_type_location.xls ` are provided by hospitals. the remaining are generated by our algorithms, There are many detailed descriptions for them as belows
+ **dicom_files_merges**: store many folders of CT images, every folder stand for a CT images of a patient.
+ **nii_files_merges**: All the fragmented location have been labeled, every .nii file stands for one or more fragmented location on one rib.
+ **bone_info_merges**: record every bones' feature and predicted score(rib or not), we can update some err predicted labels in order to expand gbdt dataset.
+ **rib_df_cache**: ribs belonging to one patient collected in `patient_id.csv`, whose columns has `x,y,z,c,v`(c is bone id, v is hu)
+ **csv_files/rib_type_location.xls**: rib fragmented type related to locations of patient in the **nii_files_merges** will be shown in the **rib_type_location.xls**.
+ **csv_files/nii_loc_df.csv**: 3d bounding-box coordinates for every fragmented locations.
+ **csv_files/join_label.csv**:join between ribs and fragmented locations, we can get the relationship between them. There are at least one rib for a fragmented location, but the opposite is not necessary.
+ **csv_files/offset_df.csv**: used for transforming rib sparse data to local picture.
